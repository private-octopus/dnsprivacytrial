// dnsPrivacyTrial.cpp
// Simple application that parses Wireshark captures, 
// filtered as DNS and exported as CSV version of the DNS dissector.
// From there, performs a set of analyzes:
// * Traffic characterization: frequency of queries, arrival model.
// * Service characterization: distribution of response times.
// * Name list: what is exposed in the list of queried names.
// * Privacy delta characterization: difference of information between the name and the corresponding IP.
